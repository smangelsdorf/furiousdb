# FuriousDB

FuriousDB is a database engine that I'm writing to learn about database internals.

Don't use this in production, or anywhere really.

## Current status

FuriousDB is currently in the very early stages of development.

I'm recording information about the development process in the
[wiki](https://github.com/smangelsdorf/furiousdb/wiki).
